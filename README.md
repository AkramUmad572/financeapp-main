# finance_webapp

I built a finance web application called "Smart Budgeter," which allows users to track their transactions and make better financial decisions. I engineered the app using Node.js and Express as the application frameworks. I developed the front end using EJS and CSS as the back end. As for the SQL database, I used MongoDB to track the users' transactions and JavaScript to connect the application with the SQL database. Additionally, I used render to deploy the application, which can be found here: https://financeapp-main-1.onrender.com/home.

# finance_webapp

I built a finance web application called Smart Budgeter, designed to help users track their transactions and make better financial decisions. I developed the app using Node.js, EJS, CSS, Express, and Bootstrap. As for data management, I used MongoDB to store transaction records and JavaScript to handle database interactions.
